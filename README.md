# 🛒 Retail Shelf Inventory Monitoring

## 📌 Introduction

Retail Shelf Inventory Monitoring is a computer vision-based system designed to automatically detect, track, and report the stock status of products on retail shelves. The goal is to optimize inventory management, reduce out-of-stock situations, and provide real-time insights for retail operations using AI and image processing technologies.

## 📖 Project Overview

In the fast-paced retail environment, keeping track of shelf inventory manually is time-consuming and error-prone. This project leverages deep learning and image processing to:

- Detect products on shelves using object detection models.
- Track inventory levels based on real-time camera feeds or uploaded images.
- Alert when shelves are empty or items are running low.
- Generate reports and analytics to assist retail managers with stocking decisions.

The system is scalable and can be adapted to various store layouts and product categories.
